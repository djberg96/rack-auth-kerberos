= 0.2.4 - 22-Apr-2010
* Krb5Auth::Krb5 object creation has been moved from the constructor into the
  call method in order to guarantee a new object is used every time. This solves
  a potential issue where krb5-auth would segfault if it tried to use an object
  that had already been closed.
* Some minor documentation updates.

* Resetting log with each call now, instead of initialize

= 0.2.1 - 28-Dec-2009
